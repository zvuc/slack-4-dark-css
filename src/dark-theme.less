// as of 2019-08-23 Slack official slack-kit-styles.css
// uses css variables for core colors, and already includes a colorset for dark theme.
// It's now just a matter of enabling the color overrides so we'll do just that
@import (inline) 'official-variables.css';

// Meanwhile there are some parts Slack still didn't address
// (which explains why they didn't release the dark mode feature officially just yet)
// So we'll fix it manually here.
